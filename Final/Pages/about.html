		<h1>About the Seven Wonders</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>The Seven Wonders of the World are a collection of remarkable ancient structures that have captivated people's imaginations for centuries. From the Great Wall of China to the Taj Mahal, these wonders represent some of the greatest achievements of human creativity and ingenuity.</p>
		<p>However, the concept of the Seven Wonders has changed over time. The original list, compiled by the ancient Greeks, included only structures that were known to them at the time. Over the centuries, new structures were added and old ones were forgotten, until the modern list of Seven Wonders was established in 2007 through a global online poll.</p>
		<p>Despite the changes in the list over time, the Seven Wonders remain an important part of world heritage and a testament to the human desire to create and build on a grand scale.</p>
		<h2>The Seven Wonders</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The Colosseum in Italy</li>
			<li>Petra in Jordan</li>
			<li>Chichén Itzá in Mexico</li>
			<li>Christ the Redeemer in Brazil</li>
			<li>Machu Picchu in Peru</li>
			<li>Taj Mahal in India</li>
			<li>The Great Wall of China</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each of the Seven Wonders has a unique story and significance that is worth exploring. This website aims to provide information and education about each of these wonders, as well as inspire curiosity and wonder about the world's cultural heritage.</p>
